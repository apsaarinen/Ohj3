\subsection*{Submodule / Course\-Library}

Submodule for Course\-Library is currently configured to use ssh. If you haven't yet setup an ssh-\/key. Go do it at \href{https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/profile/keys}{\tt https\-://course-\/gitlab.\-tuni.\-fi/profile/keys}

The page contains also instructions for generating and using existing ssh-\/keys.

Don't change anything in Course\-Library ( You won't be able to submit changes made in it )

If you find any bugs and/or missing features you can report them in Git\-Lab \href{https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/tie-02402-ohj3_2019-2020/courselibrary/issues}{\tt https\-://course-\/gitlab.\-tuni.\-fi/tie-\/02402-\/ohj3\-\_\-2019-\/2020/courselibrary/issues}

\subsection*{Other notes}

You'll probably want to remove \hyperlink{classMapWindow}{Map\-Window} and make your own, especially if you want a grade better than 1. It's in this template just so you can get started more easily and do some experimenting.

You should create your own code inside your own namespace \-:)
